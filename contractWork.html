        <th>I've been working on technology since 8th grade. Ever since my first iPod repair, to an old 95 Hard drive fix,
            to a multitude of PCs built and phones repaired and even a laptop modification. I've been working on hardware for
             almost a decade, and have become more than comfortable around anything that's a computer.

            Web development will always grow fast, and I'm determined to work along the curve. I've been self taught in HTML, CSS and Js, 
            although projects have gotten me into nextJS. I've been the most experienced with a simple webpage to render, but am currently learning 
            the development into more intricate websites with a backend.
