      <h1 class="title">Who I am <a href="#navigate">(Index)</a></h1><p>Hello! I am Brandon Kulmala, a computer science student at the university of akron.
          At the university, I have been taught core aspects of computers, and I was taught them
          with C++ in mind. When I was in high school, I was tired of never knowing programming, so
          I taught myself HTML and some CSS. I also learned that these weren't programming languages! But 
          that lets me demonstrate the knowledge I know in developing in the front end sphere of things.
          I like to work out and play video games on my free time. I enjoy the cardio side of exercise, and 
          I like the simulator side of video games. Rocket league is the only one I try competitively.</p>

        <h1>School</h1>
        <p>In high school, the only important class I took was Calculus. During my time in high school,
          I taught myself HTML and CSS. In college, I was able to take Calculus II, data structures, 
          discrete mathematics, two C++ classes, and spanish.

      <div id="CPP" class="tabcontent">
        <h1>Programming</h1>
        <p>CPP is the language I know best. I have worked with javascript and python, but not at a standalone
          process. I always write my CPP code first, and then translate it into either language.
        </p>

      <div id="HTML" class="tabcontent">
        <h1>Web development</h1>
        <p>I did teach myself HTML and CSS during high school. At the time, I didn't know these weren't programming languages,
          I just wanted to know how to program a language.

          <h1 class="title">Gallery <a href="#navigate">(Index)</a></h1><p>One of my favorite things to do when I'm bored is to travel!I live in a good area where 
          going to a new city isn't too difficult to do. At most, Akron's suburbs and city are less than an hour,and at 
          the least, I have 4 more cities less than 2 hours! I usually just go to downtown,walk a little, and then see a mall, park,
          or library, but I still enjoy being able to go out and experience new stuff.</p>

      <h1 class="title">Translator <a href="#navigate">(Index)</a></h1><p>Learning about brainf*ck, I found it as very peculiar and confusing language on the surface. I wanted to learn it, and
          on my process learning I realized it's a very knowledgeable language that helps you perceive what a pointer does in code. This
          translator app will show you just how odd of a language it is. Input any sentence you want, and this program will convert each
          character's ASCII value into its representation in brainf*ck.</p>
          <input type="text" placeholder="Type your sentence" id="inputIdOne">
          <button type="button" onclick="etb();">Enter sentence and convert.</button>
