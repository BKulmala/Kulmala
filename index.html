        <h1 class="title">Who I am <a href="#navigate"><img class="returnHome" src="Images\etc\home.png" alt="return to index"></a></h1><p>Hello! I am Brandon Kulmala, a computer science student at the university of akron.
          At the university, I have been taught core aspects of computers, and I was taught them
          with C++ in mind. When I was in high school, I was tired of never knowing programming, so
          I taught myself HTML and some CSS. I also learned that these weren't programming languages! But 
          that lets me demonstrate the knowledge I know in developing in the front end sphere of things.
          I like to work out and play video games on my free time. I enjoy the cardio side of exercise, and 
          I like the simulator side of video games. Rocket league is the only one I try competitively.</p>
