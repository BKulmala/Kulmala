      <h1 class="title">Who I am <a href="#navigate">(Index)</a></h1><p>Hello! I am Brandon Kulmala, a computer science student at the university of akron.
          At the university, I have been taught core aspects of computers, and I was taught them
          with C++ in mind. When I was in high school, I was tired of never knowing programming, so
          I taught myself HTML and some CSS. I also learned that these weren't programming languages! But 
          that lets me demonstrate the knowledge I know in developing in the front end sphere of things.
          I like to work out and play video games on my free time. I enjoy the cardio side of exercise, and 
          I like the simulator side of video games. Rocket league is the only one I try competitively.</p>

        <h1>School</h1>
        <p>In high school, the only important class I took was Calculus. During my time in high school,
          I taught myself HTML and CSS. In college, I was able to take Calculus II, data structures, 
          discrete mathematics, two C++ classes, and spanish.

      <div id="CPP" class="tabcontent">
        <h1>Programming</h1>
        <p>CPP is the language I know best. I have worked with javascript and python, but not at a standalone
          process. I always write my CPP code first, and then translate it into either language.
        </p>
      </div>
      
      <div id="HTML" class="tabcontent">
        <h1>Web development</h1>
        <p>I did teach myself HTML and CSS during high school. At the time, I didn't know these weren't programming languages,
          I just wanted to know how to program a language.
