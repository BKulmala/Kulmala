<h1>December 9th, 2022</h1>
<p>Hello. There's not too much important stuff going on,</br>
 but I'm sure something will be interesting eventually.</br></p>
<p>Starting my winter break with a few goals. Probably experimenting with</br>
 databases, definitely making my website look better. We'll see how it looks</br>
 in the end.</p>
<p>Mostly today has been working on my firebase page. website is http and I</br>
 really need to change that before hackers get my credit card information(/s)</p>
